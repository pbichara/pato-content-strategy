# Researching and Proposing Topics — Pato Bichara

Research and propose content topics for Pato Bichara's free slots (Tuesday/Wednesday) or to fill calendar gaps. Produces differentiated, well-researched topic proposals that play to Pato's unique strengths and experience.

## Before Researching

1. Read the topic research guidelines at [references/topic-research-guidelines.md](references/topic-research-guidelines.md)
2. Read the voice guidelines at `../drafting-content-posts/references/voice-guidelines.md`
3. Read the slot structure at `../drafting-content-posts/references/slot-structure.md`

## Input

The user provides any combination of:

- **Pillar gaps:** Which pillar(s) need more content this week
- **Recent performance:** What topics have worked or not worked recently
- **Internal requests:** Collective events, programs to promote, milestones
- **Current trends:** Topics trending in the ecosystem
- **Constraints:** Topics to avoid (recently covered, sensitive, off-brand)
- **Number of topics needed:** Default is 3-5

If the user provides minimal input (e.g., just "I need topics for next week"), propose based on general pillar balance and current relevance.

## Workflow

### Step 1: Understand the Context

From the input, determine:
- Which pillar(s) need content (if not specified, propose a balanced mix)
- What has been posted recently (to avoid repetition)
- Any timely hooks (news, events, trends, season)
- Format preferences or constraints

### Step 2: Generate Topic Candidates

For each pillar that needs content, brainstorm topics that meet ALL of these criteria:

1. **Pato has a right to talk about it** — He has direct experience (Collective, Bain, Harvard, Xochi) or unique data
2. **The audience would stop scrolling** — CEOs, founders, HR Leaders care about this
3. **There's a differentiated angle** — Not just the topic, but Pato's specific take on it
4. **It's timely or evergreen** — Connected to current reality or permanently useful

### Step 3: Develop Each Proposal

For each of the top 3-5 topics, provide:

1. **Titulo del tema** — Clear, descriptive title (this is NOT the hook — it's internal reference)
2. **Pilar** — 1 (Liderazgo/AI), 2 (Talento/Cultura), or 3 (Futuro del Trabajo)
3. **Angulo diferenciado** — What does Pato say about this that others don't? 2-3 sentences explaining the unique take and why Pato is credible on this topic.
4. **Hook sugerido** — One strong first-line option. Must work as a standalone sentence that stops the scroll.
5. **Puntos clave** — 3-4 key points the post would cover (bullet list)
6. **Por que ahora** — Why this topic is relevant right now (trend, event, season, news, Collective connection)
7. **Formato sugerido** — Text post or carousel, with brief rationale
8. **Nivel de esfuerzo** — Low (Pato has the content ready in his head), Medium (needs some research or data), High (needs interviews, data collection, or deep research)
9. **Fuentes sugeridas** — Where Beto can find supporting data or stories (Collective data, recent articles, Pato's past talks, etc.)

### Step 4: Rank and Recommend

Rank the proposals by a combined score of:
- **Engagement potential** — How likely is this to generate comments and shares?
- **Differentiation** — How unique is Pato's angle?
- **Effort-to-impact ratio** — Low effort + high impact = priority
- **Pillar balance** — Does this help balance the calendar?

### Step 5: Output

```
## Topic Proposals: [Week/Date if specified]

**Context:** [1-2 sentences on what gaps we're filling or what prompted the research]
**Pillar balance this week:** [Current distribution if known, or "balancing for [pillar]"]

---

### Proposal 1 (Recommended): [Topic Title]

**Pilar:** [1/2/3]
**Angulo diferenciado:** [2-3 sentences]
**Hook sugerido:** "[First line of the post]"

**Puntos clave:**
- [Point 1]
- [Point 2]
- [Point 3]

**Por que ahora:** [1-2 sentences]
**Formato:** [Text / Carousel] — [1 sentence rationale]
**Esfuerzo:** [Low / Medium / High]
**Fuentes:** [Where to find supporting content]

---

### Proposal 2: [Topic Title]

[Same structure]

---

### Proposal 3: [Topic Title]

[Same structure]

---

### [Proposal 4-5 if applicable]

---

### Calendar Recommendation

**If publishing 2 posts this week (Tue + Wed):**
- Tuesday: Proposal [X] — [1 sentence why this day]
- Wednesday: Proposal [Y] — [1 sentence why this day]

**Pillar balance after these posts:** [Projected distribution vs 45/30/25 target]

---

**Notas para Beto:**
- [Topics that were considered and rejected, with brief reason]
- [Topics that need Pato's input before drafting]
- [Any trends to watch for future weeks]
- [Suggested internal data or stories to gather]
```

## Guidelines

- **Differentiation is non-negotiable.** If 50 other people posted about this topic this week with the same angle, don't propose it. Find Pato's unique take or skip the topic.
- **Experience > opinions.** "What we learned at Collective about X" is always stronger than "I think X is important." Prioritize topics where Pato has first-hand stories or data.
- **Never propose influencer-format content.** No "5 tips for success", no "The secret to leadership", no generic listicles. Every proposal should feel like something only Pato could write.
- **Pillar balance matters.** If the user doesn't specify, check recent content and propose topics that balance the calendar toward 45/30/25.
- **Timely + evergreen is ideal.** The best topics connect a current trend to a timeless insight. "AI is changing hiring" is timely; "How to identify talent" is evergreen; "What AI revealed about how we were always hiring wrong" is both.
- **Include the why-now.** A topic without urgency will always get deprioritized. Give Beto a reason to publish this week, not next month.
- **No pedir aclaraciones.** Propose with what's available. Note assumptions in "Notas para Beto."
