# Topic Research Guidelines — Proactive Content Proposals

## Purpose

Fill calendar gaps (especially Tuesday/Wednesday free slots) with topics where Pato has a genuine edge — experience, data, or perspective that others in the space don't have.

## Content Pillars for Reference

| Pilar | Weight | Core Themes |

| 3: Futuro del Trabajo | 25% | Future skills, new career models, post-AI team redesign, university-market gap |

## Pato's Unique Angles (Differentiators)

Topics are only worth proposing if Pato can say something others can't. His unique angles come from:

### Experience-Based
- **Bain & Company:** Strategy consulting frameworks, structured problem solving, case-based thinking
- **Harvard Business School:** Academic frameworks + network, global perspective
- **Collective Academy founder:** 14K+ learners, 200+ mentors, real-time data on skill gaps and talent development
- **Xochi Ventures:** Investment perspective on LatAm startups, technology, education

### Perspective-Based
- **LatAm lens:** Everything seen through the lens of Latin American leadership, talent, and markets
- **Builder, not commentator:** Pato is building Collective, not just opining about education or AI
- **Data access:** Real data from Collective cohorts, sessions, and learner outcomes

### What Pato Should NOT Post About
- Generic AI hype without a personal take or Collective data
- Topics where he has no direct experience (pure tech implementation, coding, design)
- Political or controversial takes unrelated to business/education
- Anything that sounds like it could come from any CEO — needs his specific fingerprint

## Topic Quality Criteria

### Must-Have
1. **Pato has a right to talk about it** — Experience, data, or a genuine perspective
2. **The audience cares** — CEOs, founders, HR Leaders would pause scrolling for this
3. **It's timely OR evergreen** — Either connected to a current trend or permanently relevant
4. **There's a clear angle** — Not just "AI is changing everything" but "Here's what we're seeing at Collective about AI and talent"

### Nice-to-Have
- Connects to a recent session, event, or Collective milestone
- Can be backed by a specific data point or story
- Lends itself to a strong visual (carousel, infographic, reel)
- Creates engagement potential (debatable, question-worthy, share-worthy)

## Proposal Format

Each topic proposal should include:

1. **Titulo del tema** — Descriptive, not the hook (the hook comes during drafting)
2. **Pilar** — 1, 2, or 3
3. **Angulo diferenciado** — What does Pato say about this that others don't? 1-2 sentences.
4. **Hook sugerido** — One strong first-line option to preview the post's potential
5. **Por que ahora** — Relevance: trend, event, season, Collective milestone, news
6. **Formato sugerido** — Text post, carousel, or carousel + text
7. **Nivel de esfuerzo** — Low (Pato has the content ready), Medium (needs some research), High (needs data or interview)

## Sources for Topic Ideas

### Internal (Collective-specific)
- Recent session topics and themes
- Learner feedback and questions
- Cohort data and outcomes
- Mentor observations
- Collective milestones and announcements

### External
- LinkedIn trending topics in leadership/AI/education (LatAm and global)
- Recent business news relevant to Pato's pillars
- Competitor content analysis (what are other LatAm education/leadership voices posting?)
- Books Pato is reading (cross-pollination with Friday slot)
- Conferences and events in the ecosystem

### Audience Signals
- Questions from previous post comments
- DMs requesting specific topics
- Topics with high saves (Instagram) or shares (LinkedIn)
- Content gaps identified in performance analysis

---

## Anti-Patterns (Don't Propose These)

- **"5 tips for..."** — Format de influencer generico
- **Hot takes without substance** — "AI will replace all jobs" without nuance or data
- **Topics already covered recently** — Check last 4 weeks of published content
- **Corporate announcements disguised as content** — "We're excited to announce..." belongs in company page, not personal brand
- **Topics where Pato is just another voice** — If 50 other people posted about it this week, find a unique angle or skip it

---

## Balancing the Calendar

When proposing topics, consider:
- **Pillar balance:** If this week is heavy on Pilar 1, propose Pilar 2 or 3
- **Tone balance:** If recent posts were all educational, propose something more personal/conversational
- **Format balance:** If recent posts were all text, propose a carousel
- **Weight balance:** Not every post needs to be "heavy" — some weeks need a lighter, more personal post
