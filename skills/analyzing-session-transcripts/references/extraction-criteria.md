# Extraction Criteria — Session Analysis

## What Makes a Great Quote (#FrasesBienCollective)

### Must-Have Criteria
1. **Standalone:** Works without any context. Read it cold on a LinkedIn feed — does it hit?
2. **Specific:** Uses concrete language, not corporate generalities
3. **Memorable:** The kind of thing people screenshot or write down during a talk
4. **Attributable:** Clear who said it

### Scoring (use mentally, don't output scores)
- Standalone power: Does it work outside the session? (critical)
- Emotional resonance: Does it create a "yes!" or "hmm, never thought of that" reaction?
- Brevity: Shorter is usually better. Under 20 words ideal, up to 40 acceptable.
- Universality: Does it apply beyond the specific session context?

### Common Traps (avoid selecting these)
- Phrases that sound deep but say nothing ("El liderazgo es un viaje")
- Context-dependent statements that lose meaning outside the session
- Long paragraphs that need to be trimmed (quotes should be punchy)
- Generic motivational phrases available in any self-help book

### Examples of Strong Quotes
- "La velocidad mata menos empresas que la indecision"
- "Tu cultura no es lo que esta en la pared. Es lo que pasa cuando nadie esta viendo."
- "El problema no es que tu equipo no sepa usar AI. El problema es que no saben hacer las preguntas correctas."
- "No necesitas mas datos. Necesitas menos miedo a decidir con los que ya tienes."

### Examples of Weak Quotes (don't select these)
- "Es importante que los lideres se adapten al cambio" (generic)
- "La educacion es la base del desarrollo" (platitude)
- "Como dijo Peter Drucker, la cultura se come a la estrategia" (not original)

## What Makes a Great Insight (#JuevesCollective)

### The "Pepita de Oro" Test
The insight should make a CEO pause mid-scroll and think: "I need to rethink how I'm approaching this."

### Insight Types (ranked by LinkedIn engagement potential)
1. **Counterintuitive:** Challenges something the audience believes is true
2. **Framework:** A new way to categorize or decide something (2x2 matrix, 3-step model, spectrum)
3. **Data surprise:** A number that reframes the conversation
4. **Practical tool:** A specific question, exercise, or technique the reader can use today
5. **Story with a twist:** A narrative that sets up one expectation and delivers another

### Insight vs. Summary
| Insight | Summary |
|---------|---------|
| "Turns out the companies that adopted AI fastest didn't start with technology — they started by asking their teams what annoyed them most" | "The session covered AI adoption strategies" |
| "87% of participants said they know what to do differently but still don't do it — the gap isn't knowledge, it's permission" | "We discussed the knowing-doing gap" |

### Narrative Angle Selection
Choose the angle that maximizes LinkedIn engagement:

- **Story:** Best when there's a specific moment or person that anchors the insight
- **Framework:** Best when the insight can be visualized (slides, diagrams, models)
- **Data + reflection:** Best when there's a surprising number
- **Contrast:** Best when the insight challenges conventional wisdom
- **Debate:** Best when reasonable people disagree on the topic
